1. Unzip Package
2. Install via the Setup.exe
3. Don't forget to install SML/NQ
4. Invoke with \installdir\bin\cwb-nc

The SML Project seems better maintained than the cwb (you'll need a Postscript viewer for the cwb doc).
Here is a link to the SML Page where the binary can be downloaded: https://www.smlnj.org/
